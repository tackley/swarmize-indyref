Swarmize: example twitter stream
=================================

This rough-and-ready code was used to watch tweets with #indyref hashtag
in the period approaching and after the Scottish Referendum.

It's a [play framework](https://www.playframework.com) application written in scala. To run:

1. install scala's [simple build tool](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)
2. create a `conf/twitter4j.properties` file with your twitter api key details in it, as described [here](http://twitter4j.org/en/configuration.html)
3. `$ sbt start`
